**1. Title:**

 Computational Intelligence-Driven Innovation for Multi-disciplinary Applications in the Era of Industry 4.0 (CI4APP)

**2. Aims:**

Reflecting the most innovative activities in current businesses, design and creativity are essential to the world's economy and manufacturing industries. A rising demand for intelligent design systems has been seen in the increased requirements of customisation, flexibility, efficiency, responsiveness, and cost-effectiveness of products and their manufacturing. These requirements become more urgent in the international race to the next "industrial revolution", as highlighted by the "Industry 4.0" initiative. The latter aim to upgrade the entire manufacturing value chain through turning the factory floor into an innovation centre capable of mass customisation and high flexibility. According to research by consultancy.uk, "Industry 4.0" is to add EUR140b p.a. to European revenue. However, it is the designer, rather than the manufacturer that will profit most from innovation in this added-value upgrade.

The aim of this special session is to understand and advance current state-of-the-field and elicit a roadmap on where the research is heading, highlight key challenges and opportunities and discuss  possible solutions. It solicits state-of-the-art review and original articles that support and stimulate continuing efforts to advance research and development of computational intelligence-based approaches for multi-disciplinary optimisations and field applications.

**3. Scope:**

The special issue is open to theoretical, numerical, and experimental contributions that describe original research results, innovative concepts that address all aspects of intelligent design, multi-objective approaches, Industry 4.0, Computational Intelligence (CI) approaches and application of results in multi-disciplinary areas ranging from design and creativity, to smart city services including finance, healthcare, transportation, robotics and automation, etc.
